# Terms of Policy - CodeAura Interactive

## § 1 - Open Source and MIT License
Everything we create is open source and free. Our work is based on the MIT License, which allows you to use our "products" freely, provided you always credit the author of the code. (Refer to the LICENSE file for more details.)

## § 2 - This Studio is Not a Corporation
As mentioned in the README.md file, this is a one-person studio. It is not a corporation (Inc.), and I cannot sell my products. Instead, I publish them as open source under the MIT License.

## § 3 - Using My Code in Your Projects
To use my code in your projects, you simply need to include the author's name and the source (GitHub repository link) at the beginning of your code.

## § 4 - What Happens If You Don't Credit Me for Using My Code?
Honestly, nothing significant will happen. However, I kindly ask that you notify me via my contact email if you are using my code in your project. You may (but are not required to) include a screenshot as proof that you copied and pasted the text from MITusage.txt at the beginning of your code (see § 5 for details).

## § 5 - Contact and What to Include at the Beginning of Your Code
It would be greatly appreciated if you could contact me via my email (available on my website) to let me know that you are using my code in your project. Additionally, please copy and paste the required text from the MITusage.txt file into a comment at the beginning of your code. This text can be found in the MITusage.txt file and should be included as a comment at the start of your project code.
