      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Adrian Sikora from Poland (; . I'm currently 13 y/o my passion and hobby is programming, i started programing in 2019 so it was 6 years ago, and til now i didn't get bored with it. I'm good at python, html,c , c++ <- (I don't like that), java, javascript, css, some assembly, arduino, kotlin, rust. Those are programming languages that i was curios about and watched a few tutorials but C, python, html and java but last time i used java about half a year ago so i don't use it much. I like C < Luv it❤️. Using Linux is my passion thats what i would say and python html javascript and css yes i'm using. I did a few Operating systems wich were made in C - 🫀. Each one (i made 3 in c and one in C++) took me min. one month and max. half a year. This OS in C++ is not public and it's my biggest project it's got about 489k lines of code and i started making it in 2022 in june and started stopping improving it in 2024. That project (more debbuging it) made me hate it.</p>
